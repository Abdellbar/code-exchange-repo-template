# Cisco DevNet Code Template
This repository is a template to be used when creating a new repository containing sample code, a sample application, or some other software related to Cisco technologies and to be made available for use to the Cisco DevNet community.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository.
2. Copy these files into the new repository.
3. Update the [README](./README.md), replacing the contents below as prescribed.
4. Add any libraries, assets, or hard dependencies whose source code will be included in the project's repository to the _Exceptions_ section in the [TERMS](./TERMS.md). If no exceptions are needed, remove that section from TERMS.
5. If working with an existing code base, answer the questions on the [CHECKLIST](./CHECKLIST.md)
6. Delete these instructions and everything up to the _Project Title_ from the README.
7. Write some great software and tell people about it.

# Project Title

**Description**:  Put a meaningful, short, plain-language description of what this code is trying to accomplish and why it matters.

Other things to include:

* **Technology stack**: Indicate the technological nature of the code, including primary programming language(s) and whether the code is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.
* **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where what they can expect from this code.
* **Screenshot**: If the code has visual components, place a screenshot after the description; e.g.,



## Dependencies

Describe any dependencies that must be installed for this code to work. This includes programming languages, databases or other storage mechanisms, build tools, frameworks, and so forth.
If specific versions of other software are required, or known not to work, call that out.

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running. This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, link to a separate [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md) document.

## Configuration

If the code is configurable, describe it in detail, either here or in other documentation to which you link.

## Usage

Show users how to use the code. Be specific.
Use appropriate formatting when showing code snippets or command line output.
If a particular [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/sandbox/) or [Learning Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning-labs/) can be used in to provide a network or other resources to be used with this code, call that out here. 

## How to test the software

If the code includes automated tests, detail how to run those tests.

## Known issues

Document any known significant shortcomings with the code. If using the [Issue Tracker](./issues), make that known here and provide any templates or conventions to be followed when opening a new issue. 

## Getting help

Instruct users how to get help with this code; this might include links to an issue tracker, wiki, mailing list, etc.

**Example**

If you have questions, concerns, bug reports, etc., please file an issue in this repository's [Issue Tracker](./issues).

## Getting involved

This section should detail why people should get involved and describe key areas you are currently focusing on; e.g., trying to get feedback on features, fixing certain bugs, building important pieces, etc.

General instructions on _how_ to contribute should be stated with a link to [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
